        * Computer chooses a secret number (1-100).
        * Player gets 7 chances.
    * Guessing Attempts (Loop):
        * Count current attempt.
        * Player inputs a guess (must be a valid number 1-100).
        * Check Guess:
            * If correct, Player Wins.
            * If too low, tell player to guess higher.
            * If too high, tell player to guess lower.
        * Continue until guess is correct or chances run out.
    * End of Round:
        * Announce if player won or lost.
        * Reveal the secret number.
    * Ask to Play Again? If player says no, stop repeating games.
